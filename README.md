# Ultra Marathon Performance Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of ultra marathon races over two centuries, focusing on athlete performance, event details, and trends. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and answering key questions about speed, age groups, and seasonal performance.

The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](#).

## Key Questions
1. What is the difference in average speed between males and females for 50-km and 50-mile races?
2. Which age groups perform the best in 50-mile races?
3. How does performance vary by season?

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control and project sharing.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about ultra marathon races over two centuries. It includes the following features:
- **Event name**: Name of the race.
- **Event distance/length**: Distance of the race (e.g., 50km, 50mi).
- **Year of event**: Year the race took place.
- **Athlete performance**: Performance of the athlete (e.g., time taken).
- **Athlete gender**: Gender of the athlete.
- **Athlete average speed**: Average speed of the athlete.
- **Athlete year of birth**: Birth year of the athlete (used to calculate age).

The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](#).

## Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handled missing values and duplicates.
   - Fixed data types and renamed columns for clarity.
   - Calculated athlete age from birth year.

2. **Data Analysis**:
   - Filtered data for 50-km and 50-mile races.
   - Analyzed average speed by gender and distance.
   - Identified the best-performing age groups for 50-mile races.
   - Explored seasonal trends in performance.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Created visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib in Python.
   - Built interactive dashboards in Power BI.

4. **Insights and Conclusions**:
   - Derived key insights about athlete performance and trends.
