It seems that your `.gitignore` file is untracked and hasn't been committed yet. To ensure that it gets added and committed properly, follow these steps:

1. **Add the `.gitignore` file to Git**:
   First, add the `.gitignore` file to the staging area:
   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   ```

2. **Commit the `.gitignore` file**:
   Now commit the change:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add .gitignore to ignore CSV files"
   ```

3. **Push the commit**:
   Push the commit to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

After this, your `.gitignore` file will be tracked by Git and the CSV files will be ignored in future commits and pushes.
